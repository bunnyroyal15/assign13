        </h1>

        <p>NEW DELHI: Not only one of the best batters of his time.Virat is also the epitome of sportsmanship which have
            been witnessed on numerous occasions on the field."It was a very nice moment from Kohli in the 2019 WoWorld
            Cup, crowd was booing me.Earlier, Kohli had bestowed high praise upon the Smith, acknowledging him as the
            finest test batter from their generation.kohlis admiration for smith stems from the remarkable consistent
            and the average at which he consistently scores runs.The selectors and the captain persisted with him going
            into the 3rd Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket - an impressive 75
            - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and
            exhibited the back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed
            to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his performance in the final Test of the series. Notching up
            India's only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining light in amidst the chaos, as he stroked
            his way to a hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under pressure in
            the searing heat and pressure of Australia.
